Description: Routines to extend R's date handling by proper
    accessors (year, month, mday, etc.) and arithmetic (date
    plus 1 year).  Spurious dates arising in financial contexts
    like "2019-A", "2019-10" or "2019-Q4" are handled alongside
    `ordinary' dates.
    Routines are implemented in C and mostly parallelised using
    OpenMP for high throughput scenarios.
